## Premium
    Premum is the Price of an option

    Premium = Intrinsic value + Time Value
    e.g. 
    Nifty Call : 50 (Premium)
    Nifty Contract : 50
    Option Value : 50 * 50 = 2500

    Intrinsic Value 
        It is the amount by which option is in ITM. 
        ATM and OTM do not have intrinsic value.

    Time Value
        It is part of premium over and aboveits Intrinsic Value. 
        ATM and OTM only have Time Value.
