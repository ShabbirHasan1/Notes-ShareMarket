# 5. Options Secrets ( Revolution)

'''
    For Options Week is from Friday -> Thursday.

    Since Friday is first Day of week, Time Value is more.
    Hence on Short Side, price drop will be slow.  So on both BUY/SELL side premium fluctuation will be less.

    Second Phase, i.e. Monday to Wednesday.
    As compared to Friday Price drops will be faster.
    If we trade on Short side, there will be more momentum.
    On Wednesday, momentum will be Maximum.

    Thursday (Expiry Trick)
    1. If Price is on Dropping side, then in Initial 10 -15 mins, it will drop very fast. Hence wait on Thursday for price to settle.
        Because if trade goes opposite direction, SL will hit very fast.

    2. After Price settling, choose option with Strike price < 125 , Since today is expiry prefer on Buying CALL/PUT.
        If suppose these goes in trending, then it can reach 500. This is jackpot trick.

        Even if we keep SL of 50, then 75, 
        Here premium is already dropped, so immedidate SL hit will not happen.

        After 12 pm duration, price start to fall and SL can hit.
        
    ***On Any Day, during start of market (Initial 10 - 15 mins), keep in mind that Premium Drops very fast.
    ***If Volatility is high, then TIME VALUE & MOMENT does not work.
    ***Believe in Setup.
    ***Dont trade if views are not clear.
    ***Work using System using Risk and Money managemet.
