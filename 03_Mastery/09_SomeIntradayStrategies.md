    If for the whole day, candle does not touch the CPR of that day, it is called as a virgin CPR.

### Case 1 :
    If there is Virgin CPR on Day 1, extend CPR line for day 2.
    On Day 2, forget about its own CPR level. 
    Once the candle touches the VCPR, it immediately reverses the level.

### Case 2 :
    Similarly if the candle comes from up and touches the virgin CPR, you can expect bounce back towards upside.  
    So Virgin CPR is having some power.

### Case 3:
    In some cases the candle may also breaks the Virgin CPR and fall further. In such cases the candle reverses and come above Virgin CPR. 
    Here we take long position.

### Case 4:
    Similarly in some scenarios the candle may break the Virgin CPR and move up. Here in such cases when up candle reverses and comes below vigin cpr.
    We take short position.
